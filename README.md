# Deep_Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has networks which are capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as Deep Neural Learning or Deep Neural Network.

The following respository contains my learningd of deep learning with programming codes and necessary theory.
