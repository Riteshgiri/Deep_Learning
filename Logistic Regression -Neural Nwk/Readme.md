Building Image Recognition Algorithm. 
A classifier to classify Cats & Non-Cats images

The Python codes you see here are just an introduction to image operations and introduces  the important libraries one could use to successfully implement Gradient Descent

 We would dive deep in understanding the use of these parts and successfully train our model using gradient descent in [Building_parts_Of_Algorithm](https://github.com/Riteshgiri/Deep_Learning/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression%20-Neural%20Nwk/Building_Parts_Of_Algorithm)
