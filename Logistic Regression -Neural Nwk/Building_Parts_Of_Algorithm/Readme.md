[Building_Parts_Of_Algorithm](https://github.com/Riteshgiri/Deep_Learning/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression%20-Neural%20Nwk/Building_Parts_Of_Algorithm) introduces to important function modules required to successfully implement Gradient Descent algorithm to train your model.

The FinalModel.py encompasses all these parts (consists of all the parts) and trains your model.

The datasets folder(includes the train and test datasets) is included in this folder for ease of importing them in FinalModel.py
You might encounter the same dataset folder in [Logistic Regression -Neural Nwk](https://github.com/Riteshgiri/Deep_Learning/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression%20-Neural%20Nwk) where it is used to introduce users to image operations
